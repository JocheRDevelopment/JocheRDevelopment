# 👋 Hi, I’m @JocheRDevelopment

## 🌐 About Me
I am a passionate Fullstack Developer with 7 years of extensive experience in building diverse and challenging projects. My journey in the tech world started with a profound love for JavaScript and Python, eventually growing fond of Java through extensive enterprise-level project experience spanning over 4 years.

For personal projects, I prefer using the MERN stack due to its versatility and performance. In addition to traditional web development, I've ventured into the domain of Web 3, developing decentralized applications (DApps) using Solidity, and leveraging React for front-end development in conjunction with Truffle.

In the realm of QA Automation, my proficiency extends to technologies like Ruby, Capybara, Cucumber, Jest, TypeScript, and Mocha JS, ensuring that software not only meets its requirements but does so reliably and efficiently.

## 👀 Interests
- **Web Development:** Specializing in both frontend and backend technologies, primarily focusing on JavaScript, Python, and Java.
- **Blockchain Technologies:** Developing DApps and exploring the capacities of decentralized applications.
- **Quality Assurance:** Integrating and automating testing to ensure software reliability and efficiency.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Advancing my skills in Blockchain technologies and exploring new possibilities within decentralized finance (DeFi).
- Diving deeper into backend technologies and exploring other programming languages to stay versatile and adapt to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Innovative projects that leverage emerging technologies, especially within the domains of blockchain and Web 3.
- Open-source initiatives that aim to solve real-world problems and have a meaningful impact.
